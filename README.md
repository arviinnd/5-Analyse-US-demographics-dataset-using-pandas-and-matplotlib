Dear everyone <br>
Good morning! <br>
<br>
Subject: fifth repository <br>
<br>
Respeted everyone, this is my fifth repository. This is a dataframe giving information on the states in the United States of America, 
their abbreviations, their areas and their populations. The matching rows of the file state_abbreviations, state_areas and state 
populations have been merged. The mean, maximum and minimum areas 74253 are 656425 and 68 square miles respectively. The dataframe 
is sorted according to areas in ascending order in the notebook. The notebook also has a plot of the areas of the states at the end.
<br>
<br>
Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
Narayanan Arvind
